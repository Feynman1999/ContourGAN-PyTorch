# ToDo list
* try get as close as possible to the results of the paper...
  * **fix the content loss for G   (Crucial)**
  * fix the Loss for adversarial loss  (e,g,  using wgan-gp  etc..)
  * decoder conv bilinear interpolation init ... have not added now but refer in paper
  * normalize the input of Discriminator?  now binary image



* Enhancing Engineering
